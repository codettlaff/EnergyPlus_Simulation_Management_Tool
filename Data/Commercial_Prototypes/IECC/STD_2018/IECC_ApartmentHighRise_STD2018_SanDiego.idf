!The DOE Prototype Building Models were developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), under contract with the U.S. 
!Department of Energy (DOE).  These building models were derived from DOE's Commercial Reference Building Models with modifications 
!based on input from the ASHRAE Standard 90.1 committee, the Advanced Energy Design Guide series, and building industry experts. The 
!prototypes models were developed to quantify energy saving impacts from newly published editions of ASHRAE Standard 90.1, 189.1, IECC, 
!and other energy codes and standards.  The basic building descriptions can be found in the Scorecards posted at www.energycodes.gov 
!website. The recommended citation of the prototype models is
